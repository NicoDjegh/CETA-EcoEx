# CETA-EcoEx
This repository contains the data and code needed to reproduce the analyses and figures for the ecological examples presented in the paper "Going round in cycles but going somewhere: Deciphering cyclical dynamics using Ecological Trajectory Analysis" by Djeghri et al. submitted to Ecological Monographs. The paper presents the Cyclical Ecological Trajectory Analysis (CETA) framework.

The four Ecological Example each have their own folder containing with data (when adapted) and R code (in Rmarkdown format)  performing the analyses and producing the publication figures. Details about the data origin is given in the respective Rmarkdowns.
